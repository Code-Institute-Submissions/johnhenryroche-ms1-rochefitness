# Roche Fitness

## Gym Website

[View the Live Website Here](#)

This project comprises the development of a 6 page website for a fictional recently established gym called Roche Fitness, which is located in Deansgrange Business Park in South Dublin. 
The website has 6 separate pages to outline the services provided by the gym (Home, About, Facilities, Classes, Join & Info), and an Enquiry Form and Classes Schedule (PDF) which are accessed in new windows through call to action buttons.
The main aim of this website is to provide (i) an overview of the gym to potential customers, prior to them being able to make an Enquiry about Membership, and (ii) important information for Current Members in order that they can avail of all of the gym's services.   
In respect of the construction of the website, it has been designed to be fully responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of media devices, in order to make it easy for Current and Prospective Members to navigate the site and source information.

## Design
### Colour Scheme:

- In line with the Bootstrap dark theme that I used for the Navbar and Footer, the site generally has dark colours with varying shades of (i) black, (ii) fuschia, (iii) red and (iv) pink being used for the wording (and being set against a white background colour). 
  These colours were used to match the logo that I created for the gym. 
  When selecting the images and background images, I selected dark tones in order that the white and pink text would be easily visible in front of them, and so that they would match the design of the Navbar and Footer. 

- The colours that I used for the website are detailed in the colour chart below which I prepared on coolors.co;
![Colour Palette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71781554/102118843-27b20180-3e38-11eb-82c5-bc13e808381b.png)

### Typography
- The Roboto font (which I downloaded from Google Fonts) is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font fails to be imported. 
- As per its description on the Google Fonts website, Roboto is a font with a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric, while the font features friendly and open curves. 
I saw this font used in various projects and was keen on its design and thought that it fitted well with my overall design concept.

### Imagery
- The imagery within the website is an important feature for attracting new members. 
On this basis, the large background hero image on the Home Page of the woman weightlifting is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I used several varying images of people working out to establish the fitness aspect of the gym. 
There are four hero images throughout the site (Home, About, Join, Enquiry) all of which have athletes weight lifting or using exercise machines, while there are also several smaller images as well. 

### Wireframes
- My general site map and wireframes are saved to PDF and can be found [here](assets/images/wireframes.pdf). 
I designed them at the start of the project and they served as the basis for this project.
In review, the wireframes stayed generally consistent with the finished design, however I amended the NavBar hamburger dropdown menu for iPad and the membership options are now listed in one line at this screen size.  

## Features
- The website is responsive on all device sizes (and has been tested through Chrome Dev Tools on iPhone 6, iPhone X, iPad and Desktop).
- The website has several interactive elements, including various Bootstrap buttons which can be clicked to open up an Enquiry Form and a Class Schedule. 
Both of these open in new windows.
